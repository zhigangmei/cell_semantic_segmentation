# cell_semantic_segmentation
## Semantic segmentation model for the detection of cells in additive manufactured 316 stainless steel (AM316SS).

The segmentation model for cells in AM316SS was based on the semantic segmentation models implemented in segmentation_models.pytorch [link]. 

A Jupyter Notebook is provided to run the trained model to detect the cell structures in AM316SS. From the predicted mask files for the cell structures, the cell size and cell wall thickness can be measured using image processing techniques.

Example images for running the Juyter Notebook is provided in folder images. The trained model can be downloaded from the link here.
